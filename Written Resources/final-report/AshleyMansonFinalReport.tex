\section{Introduction}

Our vision for our completed Giguesaur application was allowing a classroom of
children, each with their own iPad, to run around and solve a virtual jigsaw
puzzle together. Imagine a classroom full of kids where they are all trying to
work on a single conventional jigsaw puzzle; such a scheme is in no way
practical. Giguesaur allows the user to view a virtual jigsaw puzzle in the real
world through the iPad's screen while the camera is pointing at a game
board. The main goal of our project was to make an application that is fun for
children to play.

% Overview of the project
\subsection{Overview}
The Giguesaur project is an application that is run on iPads where the game is
rendered using augmented reality, I will talk more of augmented reality in
section \ref{ssec:AugReality}. This allows a group of people to collaboratively
solve a virtual jigsaw puzzle. The puzzle is assembled on a \gls{GameBoard} in
the real world, where it is a checkerboard marker for the iPad's camera to
track. The jigsaw puzzle pieces that are rendered on screen will be shown
superimposed upon the game board. The user is able to interact with the jigsaw
puzzle by tapping the iPad's screen, rotating and moving the iPad around while
looking at the marker. The touch gestures and movement with the iPad allows the
user to pick up, place and move the jigsaw puzzle pieces in the game. The iPads
are connected to a central server running on a \gls{Mac} (Mac), which allows for
multiple people to interact with the jigsaw puzzle.

% Format of the project
\subsection{Project Format}
Due to the complexity and size of the Giguesaur project, it had to be divided
into three different components, as no single person would have been able to
achieve the aims and goals of the project in a single year. Joshua La Pine was
in charge of developing the computer vison component of the project, which
allows for the puzzle pieces to be rendered on top of the game board in the real
world. Shahne Rodgers took charge of the networking component of the project,
which allows more than one player to interact with the jigsaw puzzle. Finally my
part of the project was to develop the game logic and render the game to the
iPad's screen.

% Background including what a puzzle is and other games
\subsection{Background}
There are many existing jigsaw puzzle games such as Magic Jigsaw Puzzles
\cite{ref:MagicJigsaw} and Jigsaw Puzzle \cite{ref:JigsawPuzzle}. The existing
games are limited in the way they look because they use an orthographic
projection to render the jigsaw puzzles on a two dimensional board on the
computer screen. The puzzle pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are flat on the
screen. The player can only look at the virtual puzzle from top down, there is
no depth. This is a factor that does not work for the Giguesaur project, we want
it to appear that the virtual pieces exist in the real world. Another limitation
of the existing games is how the puzzles are solved, the pieces have to be
assembled into a grid. Farm And Animals Puzzles \cite{ref:FarmPuzzle} has the
grid layout shown in Figure \ref{fig:FarmsAnimals}, all the pieces have an
absolute location to be placed in. For Giguesaur I have made it possible for the
jigsaw puzzle to be solved anywhere on the game board, be it in the centre or
off in a corner.

\end{figure}

% iOS compared to Android
\subsection{Why iOS?}
\gls{iOS} is an operating system made for Apple's mobile devices, which all
present a similar interface for the user. \gls{Android} is an open source
operating system based on Linux. It runs on many versions on many different
devices \cite{ref:AndroidDevices}. The devices that Android runs cover a wide
range of screen resolutions and processing power \cite{ref:AndroidHardware}. We
had decided that the Giguesaur game would be developed for iOS for several
reasons. iOS hardware was more standardized than Android, as Apple are the only
developers of iPhones and iPads \cite{ref:iOSHardware}. It made it easy for us
to write the code. We knew that we would be relatively sure that what we
developed would work on the majority of iOS devices, at least the ones with
cameras. We could not be certain that any Android development of an application
would work. It would have not been possible, in a fourth year project, to ensure
that the application would work on all types of Android devices. Apple also have
a powerful and intuitive \gls{IDE} called \gls{Xcode}. With its detailed
profiling tools and other features such as interface builders, it made it easier
for us to develop and quickly prototype our ideas for the application.

% Brief explaination of AR and examples
\subsection{Augmented Reality} \label{ssec:AugReality}
Augmented Reality is the idea of superimposing virtual objects on top of the
real world that looks convincing enough for someone to believe what they are
seeing is actually physically real. Figure \ref{fig:ARDefender} shows a game
world being played on a coffee table while looking through an iPhone. The game
is a simple tower defence game. The user aims where the tower shoots by
moving the iPhone around the table, while the camera has a marker on the table in
view. The marker on the table, which is hidden under the projection of the
defence tower, is what allows the game to obtain the required information to
correctly pose the game objects on the table. The idea of augmented reality is
what we based the Giguesaur game on, using marker trackers to correctly pose the
puzzle pieces on the game board so it gives the idea that we are interacting
with jigsaw puzzle pieces in the real world.

\end{figure}

% Brief introduction on my work
\subsection{Game Logic}
I was in charge of developing the game logic for the Giguesaur game. This meant
I had to create the logic for how jigsaw puzzle pieces interacted with each
other and how the user interacted with the game. The jigsaw puzzle is made up of
a grid with a specific number of rows and columns, where each part of the grid
is a piece. Each piece has four edges, and an edge either has a neighbouring
piece or not. If a piece edge has a \gls{Neighbour}, it is given the ID of its
neighbour for that edge, if it has no neighbour, than the value -1 is given to
that edge. An edge of a piece can be open, meaning it has not joined to its
neighbour or closed meaning it has joined to its neighbour, or if the edge has
no neighbour it is unjoinable, meaning it can't join or be joined to another
piece for that edge. An unjoinable edge is the outside edge of the puzzle. Each
piece of the puzzle has a unique ID, a position in space, or an x, y coordinate
on the board, and a rotation with a value between 0 and 360 degrees. The z
coordinate is assumed to be 0, so it is ignored. This is what makes up the game
logic for the jigsaw puzzle. I made up my own data structure to store these
details. All the pieces that are in the game are stored in an array, where the
piece ID is the index of the array where the piece is stored. The x, y
coordinate determines where on the board the piece is displayed and the rotation
affects the orientation of the piece. The board that the pieces are placed on
has a width and length, which are along the x, y axis, which confines where the
puzzle pieces can be placed, as all the pieces have an x, y coordinate. Figure
\ref{fig:GameLogic} presents a diagram of the game logic in the game.

\section{Achievements}

% Work done on Mac
\subsection{Prototype}
In the beginning of the project I developed a prototype of the Giguesaur game
for Mac, using some simple \gls{OpenGL} routines to render the game. Working on
the Mac version helped when I was creating the game logic for the application,
as I could quickly test my ideas for the game logic such as jigsaw puzzle piece
interaction. It also allowed me to quickly try out ideas that would be time
consuming on iOS. What I achieved with the prototype is the following; It
allowed me to get to grips with OpenGL, calling all the drawing routines and
understanding the coordinate system, I completed and implemented all the game
mechanics for the game, picking up and dropping pieces and the snapping of
pieces, and I also tested out using a perspective projection to render the game
in a proper perspective. Figure \ref{fig:MacBuild} shows what the game looks
like with a perspective projection. The broken up picture of the puppy
\cite{img:OpenGLPuppy} represents the jigsaw puzzle pieces, the green background
represents the game board the pieces are placed on, and the white borders on the
edge of the game board is the `out of bounds' area of the game board, where the
pieces could not be placed. It demonstrates pieces being snapped together, as
some of the jigsaw pieces are directly adjacent.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}

\caption{Screenshot of a prototype running on the Mac.}
\label{fig:MacBuild}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

% What the game can do
\subsection{Game Mechanics}

% The logic for piece snapping
\subsubsection{Snapping Pieces}
I wanted to enable a feature that allowed pieces to snap together. Meaning if a
piece was within a specified distance of its neighbour it would snap to it. The
piece being placed back on the board would move so that the two pieces were
right next to each other, which is shown in the Java Jigsaw Puzzle game made by
Centurio \cite{ref:SourceJigsaw}. This also has the added bonus of not having to
rely on the user to carefully place pieces together. The way the check is made
to see if two pieces should snap together is by comparing the distances between
the corresponding corner points, and if the distances are less than the snap
variable, the pieces snap together. If the piece being put back on the board is
being snapped to its left neighbour piece, the original piece top left point and
the neighbour's top right point are checked, as well as the original piece
bottom left point and the neighbour's bottom right point. The reason two
distances are checked is to make sure that piece rotations are taken into
consideration when snapping pieces together, so as to avoid an unusual snap
where a piece rotated 90 degrees snaps to its neighbour not rotated. When a
piece is snapped to another piece, the piece saves the rotation of its neighbour
as its own, so that when the change is rendered, they both have the same
rotation when beside each other. Figure \ref{fig:PieceSnapping} shows the piece
snapping mechanic with a diagram. For a puzzle to be considered solved, all the
pieces should be snapped to their corresponding neighbours. Once a piece has
snapped to its neighbour, a variable for that edge is set as closed, as well as
the neighbour's edge. So if a piece has snapped to its right neighbour, its
right edge is set as closed and the neighbour's left edge is set as closed. The
check to see if the puzzle has been solved goes through all the piece's edges to
see if they are all closed.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth, center]{images/PieceSnappingDiagram}
\caption{Diagram of the Piece Snapping.}
\label{fig:PieceSnapping}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

% How piece rotations are handled
\subsubsection{Piece Rotations}
Each piece has an x, y coordinate which defines where on the game board the
piece is rendered, they also have a rotation variable that defines how the
piece is oriented on the game board. The rotation is around the z axis, where
the z axis is pointing out from the screen. The addition of rotation for puzzle
pieces added some complications to the logic of the game, in particular how I
calculated the distance between pieces for snapping as well as rendering the
pieces on screen with the correct rotations. Originally when I calculated the
distance between pieces I had been doing a simple check to see if the piece's
corner coordinates plus the length of a piece was in the range of the corner
coordinates of its neighbour. This failed to work when piece rotations were
added, as adding the side length to the coordinates did not take into
consideration the rotation. As a replacement, I now calculate the distance
between piece corners using Euclidean distance formula: 

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
d = \sqrt{(x_o - x_n)^2 + (y_o - y_n)^2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Where $d$ is the distance, $x_o$ and $y_o$ are the coordinates of the original
piece, and $x_n$ and $y_n$ are the piece's neighbour coordinates. As I take two
measurements for each corner coordinates, the rotation of the pieces no longer
affect the calculation of the distances.\\

To apply the rotation to the piece itself I use the following simple formula:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
x' = \cos(\theta) \times (x - x_c) - \sin(\theta) \times (y - y_c) + x\_cen\\ 
y' = \sin(\theta) \times (x - x_c) + \cos(\theta) \times (y - y_c) + y\_cen
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Where $x$ and $y$ are the piece corner coordinates, $x_c$ and $y_c$ are
the piece centre coordinates, $\theta$ is the piece rotation in radians, and
$x'$ and $y'$ are the new corner coordinates. I applied this formula for all four
corners of a piece to get the correct rotated piece coordinates.

% The Logic for picking up and dropping pieces
\subsubsection{Picking Up and Placing Pieces}
To pick up a piece the user taps the image of a piece on the screen. That piece
is then stored in the user's `inventory' and they are no longer able to pick up
another piece, until they have placed the piece that they are holding back on
the board. The inventory is a term I am using to state if the user is holding or
not holding a piece, as it is possible to easily check if it is empty or
not. The screen x, y coordinate from a finger tap is converted to a board x, y
coordinate, z is ignored as it is assumed to be 0. If this is close enough to a
piece then that piece is added to the user's inventory. When the user is holding
a piece, it is moved to the iPad's centre of the screen and projected on the
board. This means the user has to rotate and move the iPad around to move the
piece around the board. Once the user taps the screen again, where the piece is
projected on the board, is where the piece will be placed.

% Porting to iPad including changes and problems incountered
\subsection{Port to iPad}
Once I had established a working prototype for the Mac, the next step was to
port the code to an iPad. The port proved to be more difficult than I had
initially predicted. Firstly, OpenGL is handled completely differently with iOS
than on a Mac, as it requires the use of \gls{OpenGLES}, of which I had no
experience. OpenGL ES is a subset of OpenGL, which applies a number of different
methods to do its rendering. When using OpenGL ES with iOS, there is a lot of
set up code that is needed for any rendering to take place. Set up like getting
a reference to OpenGL ES context was required. As I had to learn the fundmantals
of OpenGL ES, I based a lot of my set up code from Wenderlich tutorial
\cite{ref:RayOpenGL} on how to create an OpenGL ES 2.0 application for
iOS. Secondly, the majority of the libraries I had written for the Mac prototype
had to be re-worked and re-written to work with iOS, as some issues like data
structures were not compatible across the different environments. For example an
`NSPoint' on Mac cannot be used on iOS, instead it is replaced with
`CGPoint'. The initial port to iOS did not have a perspective projection, which
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:iPadPort}. However, this was the first step into
getting the application onto an iPad.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/iPadPortImage}
\caption{Screenshot of the first port to iOS.}
\label{fig:iPadPort}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

% Integrating with others including problems incountered
\subsection{Integration}
After Shahne, Josh, and I had spent the first semester working on our individual
components of the Giguesaur project, it was decided it was time to begin the
integration of the three components. It was predicted this would be a difficult
process and would take a lot of time to get everything working together. As per
the prediction, integration did take a lot of time. Not only did we find that
some of our code was not compatible, either because of inconsistent data types
or incorrect implementations of routines, but other problems popped up such as
OpenGL and \gls{OpenCV} not working together. Shahne and I had little or no
difficulty during the integration process. On the other hand, Josh and I were
having consistent trouble getting our parts working together. It resulted in
Josh and my code being closely integrated, as we had to work together to get the
application to properly render to the iPad's screen. The following subsections
will go into more detail about my part being integrated with my two team
members.

\subsubsection{Network and Game Logic}
For the game logic to work with the networking component, the game logic that
handled piece snapping and checking for the puzzle being solved had to be moved
into the server code. The reason for this is that all players in a game had to
be getting the same piece locations. As the piece snapping code has the chance
to change the coordinates of pieces it had to be placed in the server. When a
piece did snap, all clients connected to the server got the updated piece
location, so that it could be reflected when the game rendered the pieces in
their correct places. The code that checks when a puzzle is solved was also put
with the server code. When it finds that the puzzle has been solved, the server
can inform all the players.\\

When a player attempts to pick up/place a piece on the game board, the client
has to ask the server if this is a legal action or not. This was a simple change
with my code to make this work. The logic for picking up and placing pieces will
call the routines from the networking component of the code. Once the server
responds, then my code will either pick up/place the piece or take no action
based on the response. Shahne had already prepared for this change to the code,
so this was smooth integration of our parts of the project.\\

The only difficulty that occurred when integrating the network and game logic was
that I had stored all my piece locations as floats, while Shahne had stored the
piece's coordinates as integers. This meant that when the clients asked the
server if it was legal to place a piece in a certain place, the server would
store the locations as integers, and update all clients of a possibly incorrect
location. This seems quite innocent at first as the lost information is quite
small. However my code that calculated piece snapping has a fractional component
as a result after it computes. An integer would lose this information, which
shows if pieces were rotated to an obscure angle, the result would calculate a
float, and the server would interpret these as integers. The pieces then could
have the possibility to snap together incorrectly and be offset from each other
showing a visible line between them. The fix was to declare the integer
locations as floats.

\subsubsection{Vision and Game Logic}
The integration of the vision and game logic did not go as smoothly as we would
have liked. The challenge here was to have the puzzle pieces rendered on top of
the game board in the real world. We had Josh's OpenCV code computing a
model-view matrix which was passed to my OpenGL code. The model-view matrix
would be used to correctly transform and change the perspective of the rendering
routines to have the pieces rendered upon the game board. This failed however,
as when we put this plan into practice the puzzle pieces disappeared from
view. Development on the project came to a halt as we tried to fix the problem,
but after a lot of time was spent attempting to solve the problem, we decided to
have OpenCV render the puzzle pieces instead, so we could move on with the rest
of the project.\\

The different coordinate systems of OpenGL and OpenCV resulted in reverse logic
for snapping of puzzle pieces. As I had written my routines with the y-axis
going bottom-up as OpenGL does it, OpenCV has the y-axis going top-down. The
change to my code that I had to do to make this work was when calculating
whether a piece can snap to its up/down neighbour, reverse the result, so when a
piece would have snapped above a piece, it will now snap below it.\\

Now the rendering and setting up of the frames is being handled by the OpenCV
routines, and my OpenGL code is being used to render the frames to the iPad's
screen after each frame update. 

% Rendering of the game
\subsection{Rendering}
I used OpenGL to apply the rendering of the Mac prototype build and the initial
port to iOS, however in the final integrated application OpenCV was being used
to create an image that is passed to the OpenGL code for it to be rendered to
the screen. The reason it is done this way is because the puzzle piece textures
have to be copied on top of the frame coming in from the camera, which requires
some extra processing to ensure the textures are shown correctly, rather than
having the puzzle pieces being rendered over the video feed coming from the
camera. Once the client receives an image file from the server, the OpenCV
routines take the file and convert it into an OpenCV image matrix for
processing. As the main image makes up the entire puzzle texture, it has to be
split up into sections for each puzzle piece that needs to be displayed on the
game board. The number of pieces determine the number of sections there will be
as each puzzle piece will need its own section of the texture. Then for each
puzzle piece, if it is meant to be displayed currently, the OpenCV routines will
copy the associated section of the texture to the image frame.

\section{Results}
We have managed to build a working application. The following video shows a
small demonstration of the Giguesaur application:
\url{https://www.dropbox.com/s/ronq5lmhca4h04c/Giguesaur.mp4?dl=0}. The video is
hosted on Dropbox. Figure \ref{fig:iPadFinal} is two screenshots from different
perspectives from two iPads. Both iPads are able to see the same puzzle being
rendered upon the game board. You are able to pick up and place down puzzle
pieces. The puzzle can be solved by having all the pieces join up to their
corresponding neighbours. The final release for the complete project is
available at:
\url{https://github.com/ShahneRodgers/Giguesaur/releases/tag/v1.0}.

\section{Conclusion}

% Final Wrap Up
\subsection{Discussion}
The Giguesaur application is working, although there are still a couple of
problems with the finished product. The performance of the application is slow,
as it runs at a low five frames a second. This causes problems when interacting
with the puzzle on screen. If a user were to move the iPad away from the marker
it tracks, it would grind to a halt and stall. It often takes too long to
recover for it to be reasonable, so it does not make for a fun game. Due to the
low frame rate, it can be difficult to pick up and place puzzle pieces. A group
of players are able to play with the same jigsaw puzzle, though we have only
tested this with two iPads as that's all we have. One player is able to pick up
a piece and the other player can see that piece disappear from the game
board. The two players are able to work together to solve the virtual jigsaw
puzzle. Using the iPad's camera, they are able to see the puzzle pieces on top
of the real world game board. Although we were met with challenges and problems, I
believe we have achieved what was set out from the original aims and objectives;
to build an augmented reality jigsaw puzzle game where a number of people can
play together.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/BigBoardImage}
\caption{Screenshot of us playing on a large game board.}
\label{fig:BigGameBoard}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

% What hasn't been done
\subsection{Future Work}
There were still several things that I have missed out on implementing for the
game logic and rendering of the Giguesaur application. Firstly, puzzle pieces
are still only simple square polygons. For future recommendations, this would
ideally be changed so that pieces have curved edges, similar to Figure
\ref{fig:FarmsAnimals} earlier in the document. The curved edges to pieces would
make the virtual jigsaw puzzle look more like a conventional jigsaw puzzle, and
it would allow for players to more easily solve the puzzle rather than having to
match the images on the current puzzle pieces. This could be implemented using a
pseudo random number generator that would choose a certain number of points
along each piece's edge, and then map vertices along each point, which would be
used to generate a suitable curve.\\

Secondly, the application is quite slow, with it only running at a maximum of
five frames per second. This is caused by the OpenCV functions that compute the
perspective projection matrix. The routines are looking for a checkerboard
pattern every frame from the camera. Another slow down to the application could
be due to how we are rendering the game, as each frame from the camera is being
processed and sent to the OpenGL code for rendering. If we had more time to
experiment we could attempt to try have the puzzle pieces being rendered on top
of the video feed coming from the camera.\\

Finally, there is no real way to know when you as a player are holding a puzzle
piece. As of right now, when a player picks up a puzzle piece it moves to the
centre of the screen and then gets projected onto the game board. This would be
used to show where, if the player were to tap the screen, the piece would be
placed back onto the board. What should be happening is when a player picks up a
piece it should show a larger image of the puzzle piece in the centre of the
screen with it being partially transparent, and be casting a shadow where the
piece will appear on the game board.

\subsection{Final Thoughts}
The Giguesaur project has been a challenging and fun experience for me. I have
learnt a lot about developing a large piece of software while collaborating with
a team. I would have loved to have had more time to work more on the project so
that I could have achieved more.
